# pmetal bench

Benchmark training performance, generation speed, and FFI overhead.

Benchmark various aspects of PMetal's performance on your hardware.

## Subcommands

### bench

Benchmark training throughput (tokens/second, step time).

```bash
pmetal bench --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --batch-size 4
```

### bench-gen

Benchmark the generation loop — tokens per second, time to first token, and decode latency.

```bash
pmetal bench-gen --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --prompt "Hello" --max-tokens 100
```

### bench-ffi

Benchmark FFI overhead between Rust and Metal/MLX.

```bash
pmetal bench-ffi
```
