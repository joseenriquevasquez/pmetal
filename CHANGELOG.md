## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.11] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- **Fused MoE Metal kernels** (`fused_moe.metal`, `fused_moe.rs`): High-performance fused MoE implementation that handles expert selection, dequantization, and computation in a single pass. Substantial improvement in token-per-second throughput for large MoE models like Qwen3Next and DeepSeek-V3
- **Expert Management infrastructure** (`expert_io.rs`, `expert_prefetch.rs`, `expert_layout.rs`): Specialized infrastructure for asynchronous expert prefetching and zero-copy loading from unified memory. Overlaps I/O with computation to hide loading latency
- **DeepSeek-V3 style routing** (`MoERouter`): Added auxiliary-loss-free load balancing via dynamic routing bias. Equalizes expert load without the performance penalty of traditional Switch Transformer auxiliary losses
- **`pmetal pack-experts` CLI command**: New subcommand for preprocessing raw expert weights into optimized layouts for the fused MoE kernels
- **`pmetal-data::inference_config` module**: `load_sampling_defaults()` and `collect_all_stop_tokens()` extracted from the CLI and easy API into a shared module consumed by the CLI, GUI Tauri backend, and Python bindings. Eliminates duplicated stop-token and sampling-default logic across three call sites
- **`pmetal-hub::resolve` module**: `resolve_model_path()` exposed as a public re-export, shared by the trainer orchestrator, Python bindings, and Tauri commands without duplicating the download-or-local-path logic
- **`pmetal-trainer::preference_data` module**: Preference dataset handling for DPO/RLKD training workflows; `resolve_dataset_path()` made public and re-exported from `lib.rs`
- **GUI streaming inference via Tauri commands**: `run_inference_streaming()` helper uses `pmetal-data` / `pmetal-hub` / `pmetal-models` directly (replaces former `easy::infer()` builder call), enabling real token-by-token streaming with full stop-token and sampling-config support
- **CLI `--loss-scale` flag**: Multiplies gradients during backward for ANE training at >350M params to prevent fp32 underflow; automatically unscaled before the optimizer step. Default `1.0` (no change to existing behaviour)
- **`inference.rs` example**: Low-level inference example using `pmetal-models` / `pmetal-hub` / `pmetal-data` directly, without the easy builder API
- **Comprehensive documentation site** (`docs/`): Getting-started, installation, hardware, models, training, CLI reference (21 commands), configuration, SDK, Python, and contributing guides
- **Metal GPU backward kernels** (`dw_gemm.metal`, `dw_gemm.rs`): Tiled fp32 SGEMM kernel replaces per-layer cblas CPU worker thread for weight gradient GEMMs in ANE training. All 7 per-layer dW GEMMs are encoded into a single `BatchedCommandBuffer` for one GPU-CPU sync per step. `LayerGradients` fields migrated from `Vec<f32>` to `MetalBuffer<f32>` (shared unified memory, zero-copy CPU/GPU access). Projected 5.5x backward pass speedup at 579M params
- **GUI adapter discovery** (`list_trained_adapters`): Scans `~/pmetal-output/` for trained LoRA adapters. Reads `adapter_config.json` + `training_info.json` for rank, alpha, base model, and dataset metadata. Displays descriptive names like "Qwen3-0.6B-Base + alpaca-cleaned r=16"
- **GUI adapter dropdowns**: Fuse modal and inference page replace manual path entry with adapter select dropdowns. "Custom path..." fallback for arbitrary paths. Fuse modal auto-fills base model when adapter has known metadata
- **GUI inference chat UX**: Copy button on all messages (hover reveal with checkmark feedback), regenerate button on assistant responses (re-runs same prompt with current config)
- **GUI auto-named training output**: Default output directory is now `~/pmetal-output/{model}-{method}-{YYYYMMDD-HHMM}` instead of generic `output`. Training writes `training_info.json` with base model, dataset, and method metadata
- **GUI chat template support**: Inference applies model-specific chat templates (ChatML, Llama3, Gemma, Nemotron, etc.) via `detect_chat_template()`. System message passed through template formatting instead of raw concatenation
- **`save_adapter_config_with_base()`**: Adapter config now includes `base_model` field for adapter discovery

### Removed

- **`pmetal::easy` module** (breaking for direct users): The high-level `easy::finetune()` / `easy::infer()` builder API is removed from the `pmetal` umbrella crate. Callers should use `pmetal_trainer::orchestrator::run_training()` for training and the `pmetal-models` / `pmetal-hub` / `pmetal-data` crates directly for inference. The `easy` feature flag is removed from `Cargo.toml`; the `data` feature is added to the default set
- **`inference_easy.rs` and `finetune_easy.rs` examples**: Removed alongside the easy API. Replaced by `inference.rs` and `finetune_manual.rs`

### Fixed

- **CLI inference helper duplication**: `load_sampling_defaults` and `collect_all_stop_tokens` were defined inline in `main.rs` (~170 loc); now delegated to `pmetal_data::inference_config`. No logic change
- **Trainer `resolve_model_path` Hub routing**: Previously had a feature-flag branch that fell through to a local-path fallback even when the Hub feature was enabled; now unconditionally delegates to `pmetal_hub::resolve_model_path()`
- **ANE inference adapter loading**: `load_lora_adapter()` now accepts both `"alpha"` and `"lora_alpha"` keys in adapter_config.json, and checks for both `lora_weights.safetensors` (pmetal) and `adapter_model.safetensors` (HF/PEFT)
- **GUI inference chat template encoding**: Uses `encode_with_special_tokens()` for chat-template-formatted prompts so special tokens (`<|im_start|>`, `<|im_end|>`) are properly tokenized instead of split into subwords. Fixes models like Nemotron generating one token then stopping
- **Qwen3.5 multimodal weight loading**: `load_qwen3_next_weights()` skips `model.visual.*` and other non-text weights instead of erroring, allowing text-only inference from multimodal model checkpoints
- **NemotronH hybrid inference**: Streaming path now creates and passes Mamba cache for hybrid models (NemotronH). Previously passed `None`, causing recurrent layers to produce garbage after the first token

### Changed

- **`crates/pmetal-gui/build/` gitignored**: Build artifact directory removed from git tracking. The bare `build` gitignore rule scoped to `crates/pmetal-gui/build/` to avoid ignoring unintended directories
- **Minimum Rust version bumped to 1.86**: Updated README badge, CONTRIBUTING prerequisites, and related documentation
- **CLI commands table in README**: Documents `rlkd` and `embed-train` commands added in 0.3.9; updates `grpo` description to mention VLM, speculative, and async-rewards modes

## [0.3.10] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- **Training orchestrator** (`pmetal-trainer::orchestrator`): Single `run_training()` entry point replaces four separate training pipeline implementations (CLI ~1000 lines, GUI ~190 lines, easy API ~200 lines, TUI bridge ~70 lines). All consumers now share one canonical pipeline with: ANE training with GPU fallback, QLoRA and standard LoRA, all dispatch modes (packed, compiled, metal-fused, standard), adaptive LR, checkpointing, metrics callbacks, and phase status reporting. Net -1300 lines of duplicated pipeline code
- **`TrainingJobConfig` struct**: Replaces 38 positional parameters with a typed config struct. Includes `DispatchConfig` (optimization flags), `QLoraOrchConfig` (quantization), `TrainingPhase` enum (status reporting), and `PhaseCallback` trait (GUI/TUI status wiring)
- **ANE large-vocab support** (`VocabMap::from_token_ids`, `VocabMap::remap_u32`): ANE training now correctly handles models with vocab > 65536 (e.g. Qwen3 @ 151936). Token IDs are processed as u32 through VocabMap compaction before converting to the u16 format required by ANE IOSurface operations. Previously, u32→u16 casting silently truncated IDs above 65535, corrupting embeddings and gradients
- **ANE first-class metrics**: ANE training path now wires `MetricsJsonCallback` with per-step metrics (loss, tok/s, ANE timing breakdowns), config JSON, and user-provided callbacks (cancel support). Previously ANE produced no metrics output, making GUI/TUI appear stuck during ANE training

### Fixed

- **GUI metrics not updating during training**: Metrics file watcher now detects file truncation (from ANE→GPU fallback) and resets read position. Previously `last_pos` exceeded the new file length after truncation, causing the watcher to skip all new data indefinitely
- **GUI output path relative to process cwd**: Training output now resolves to `~/pmetal-output/` instead of relative to the GUI's working directory (`crates/pmetal-gui/src-tauri/`). Absolute paths from the frontend are preserved as-is
- **GPU metrics callback truncates ANE metrics**: GPU `MetricsJsonCallback` creation moved to after ANE attempt completes, so ANE metrics aren't wiped on fallback
- **GUI drops warmup/lr_schedule/save_steps/logging_steps**: All four fields from the GUI training config DTO are now properly mapped to `TrainingConfig` instead of falling through to defaults
- **Phase status not visible in GUI**: Added `tokio::task::yield_now()` after each phase emit in pre-MLX orchestrator phases and ANE path, allowing the tokio runtime to deliver status events between blocking operations
- **TUI missing `embedding_lr` and `lr_schedule` parsing**: Direct training path now parses `--embedding-lr` and `--lr-schedule` args that were previously ignored
- **Easy API drops `embedding_lr`**: `FinetuneBuilder` now maps `embedding_lr` into `TrainingConfig.embedding_learning_rate`

- **GUI live training dashboard**: Full-screen live view replaces the config form when training is active. Includes real-time loss curve (SVG), metric cards (loss, best loss, tok/s, LR, grad norm, progress %), run details panel with hyperparameters, and progress bar. Config form returns when training stops
- **GUI cached dataset dropdown**: Dataset selector uses a `<select>` dropdown (matching the model selector style) with cached HuggingFace datasets, plus a text input for custom paths or HF dataset IDs
- **GUI dataset column picker**: When a dataset is selected, columns are auto-detected and shown in dropdowns for text, prompt (loss masking), and format selection. Falls back to manual text input when columns can't be detected
- **Multi-column dataset support** (`--text-columns col1,col2`): Concatenate multiple JSONL columns as training text. CLI: `--text-columns thinking,solution --column-separator "\n\n"`. GUI: ordered pill builder with add/remove/reorder. All training paths (Train, Distill, GRPO, RLKD) support column flags uniformly via shared `build_column_config` helper
- **Custom dataset columns** (`--text-column`, `--prompt-column`, `--response-column`): CLI, GUI, TUI, and easy API support arbitrary JSONL column names via `DatasetFormat::Custom`. Prompt column enables loss masking; prompt+response columns concatenate with masking. Distill, GRPO, and RLKD commands now also accept column flags
- **Unified `from_jsonl_tokenized`**: Merged `from_jsonl_tokenized` and `from_jsonl_tokenized_with_columns` into a single method with `columns: Option<&DatasetColumnConfig>`. All 18 call sites updated. DRY across CLI, TUI, GUI, easy API, and Python bindings
- **Dataset statistics and seq len validation**: `DatasetStatistics` with min/max/mean/median/p95/p99 lengths, truncation count/percentage, and suggested `max_seq_len`. `validate_seq_len()` warns when >10% truncated or mean length much shorter than max_seq_len. Logged for all training paths: Train, Distill, GRPO, RLKD, and easy API
- **`peek_dataset_columns`**: Tauri command + API function — reads first JSONL record and returns field names for the GUI column picker
- **GUI training status phases**: Live status messages during setup ("Loading model...", "Loading dataset and tokenising...", "Training...") so users see what's happening before metrics arrive
- **GUI training config summary**: Hyperparameters (LR, batch, seq len, LoRA rank, packing, flash attention) displayed in the active training banner and run detail panel
- **GUI failed-run alerts**: Failed training runs immediately surface with error message in a red banner, no longer hidden until the user clicks stop
- **GUI auto-updater**: Tauri updater plugin with signed update artifacts and `latest.json` manifest in GitHub releases
- **TUI setup phase indicator**: Dashboard shows "Loading model and preparing dataset..." in loss chart and stats panel while model loads, before any metrics arrive
- **TUI `JobPhase` event**: New `AppMsg::JobPhase` message propagates setup status from the command runner to the dashboard
- **TUI dataset peek**: Shows detected columns, estimated token lengths, and seq len warnings when a dataset is selected in the training form
- **GUI seq len warnings**: Contextual warnings under the max seq len input — red (most samples truncated), amber (some truncated), blue (wasteful). Shows "Based on first N rows" with a "check all rows" button that scans the full dataset on the backend
- **GUI retry button**: Completed/cancelled/failed runs show "Retry with these settings" which loads the run's config back into the form for adjustment and re-launch
- **Easy API `on_status()` callback**: Reports granular setup phases (resolving model, resolving dataset, loading tokenizer, tokenizing dataset, loading LoRA adapters, training) — wired to GUI for real-time phase display
- **`find_cached_model` / `find_cached_dataset`** (`pmetal-hub`): Fast local cache lookup for HF repos without network calls

### Fixed

- **Cached models re-downloaded on every training start** (`pmetal-hub`): `download_model` and `download_dataset` now check the local HF cache (`~/.cache/huggingface/hub/`) before making any network calls. If a valid snapshot exists, the cached path is returned instantly. Eliminates ~10s startup latency for cached models across all consumers (CLI, TUI, GUI, easy API, Python SDK)
- **Seq len suggestions use next-multiple-of-64** instead of next-power-of-2, producing practical values (7168 instead of 8192) for GPU-aligned training
- **Non-string dataset columns crash** (`parse_custom_line`): Selecting a column containing an array (e.g. OpenAI `messages` chat format) or number crashed with "not a string". Now handles all JSON types: arrays of message objects auto-extract role+content, numbers/booleans convert to string, other types serialize to JSON. Relates to #2

- **GUI/API trending models and datasets stale**: Changed HuggingFace API sort from `sort=downloads` (all-time) to `sort=trending` for default browse views. Search queries still sort by downloads. Fixed hardcoded User-Agent version string to use `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`
- **HF dataset ID resolution** (`pmetal-data`, `easy.rs`, `commands.rs`, `main.rs`): HuggingFace dataset IDs (e.g., `nohurry/Opus-4.6-Reasoning-3000x-filtered`) and local HF cache directories are now resolved to the actual data file within. Traverses `snapshots/{hash}/` structure, follows symlinks, finds `.jsonl`/`.json`/`.parquet`/`.csv`/`.arrow` in priority order
- **Dataset directory passed as file path**: All three resolution sites (`easy.rs`, GUI `commands.rs`, CLI `main.rs`) now call `resolve_dataset_path_pub` for `DatasetSource::Local` directories instead of passing them as-is to `from_jsonl_tokenized`
- **Metrics not appearing in GUI/TUI**: `log_every` changed from 10 to 1 in `easy.rs` so metrics appear after the first training step. `MetricsJsonCallback` now flushes every step for the first 20 steps (then every 5), ensuring watchers see data promptly
- **`train_start` event handling in GUI**: `apply_metrics_to_training` now recognizes the `train_start` event, sets status message, and reads `total_epochs` from step metrics
- **Watcher task leak on training completion** (GUI + TUI): `finalize_training_run` (and distillation/GRPO variants) now sets `cancel_flag = true` so the 500ms metrics-polling task exits. TUI `CommandRunner::remove()` now calls `job.cancel.cancel()` before dropping
- **QLoRA re-resolves dataset**: `run_qlora_training_in_process` now receives the pre-resolved `PathBuf` instead of re-downloading from HuggingFace on every run
- **Stale status message on failure**: `finalize_training_run` clears `status_message` to `None` so "Loading model..." doesn't overlay the error message
- **README.md failure aborts dataset download** (`pmetal-hub`): README failures are now non-fatal warnings; only data file download failures abort
- **MLX mutex crash on GUI exit**: Added `on_window_event(Destroyed)` handler that calls `std::process::exit(0)` to skip C++ destructor crashes from MLX Arrays dropped on the wrong thread
- **TUI log corruption**: Tracing subscriber suppressed in TUI mode to prevent stderr writes from corrupting the raw terminal. Optional `PMETAL_LOG_FILE` env var for file-based debug logging (with graceful fallback on bad paths)
- **`log_lines` dead code removed**: Removed unused `log_lines` field from `TrainingRun`, `DistillationRun`, and `GrpoRun` GUI state structs

### Changed

- **Release workflow**: Added Tauri signing keys, updater artifacts (`.tar.gz` + `.sig`), and `latest.json` manifest generation for auto-updates
- **GUI Cargo.toml**: Added `tauri-plugin-updater` and `tauri-plugin-process` dependencies

## [0.3.9] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- **RLKD CLI command** (`pmetal rlkd`): Reinforcement Learning with Knowledge Distillation — combines GRPO policy gradient optimization with distillation from a frozen teacher model. CLI exposes `--alpha`, `--final-alpha`, `--anneal-alpha`, `--top-k-distill`, all SFT/LoRA arguments, and `MetricsJsonCallback` integration
- **Embedding training CLI command** (`pmetal embed-train`): Sentence-transformer fine-tuning for BERT/encoder models with contrastive losses (InfoNCE, Triplet, CoSENT). Supports pair and triplet datasets, configurable pooling (CLS, Mean, LastToken), L2 normalization toggle, and automatic tokenizer/config copying to output
- **GRPO VLM mode** (`--vlm`): Vision-Language Model support for GRPO training with image inputs. Loads images from dataset `images` field, passes to reward functions, uses `forward_with_images` for multimodal forward passes. Configurable `--max-image-size`
- **GRPO ML reward model** (`--reward-model`): Pretrained reward model scoring during GRPO. Loads from local path or HuggingFace ID, runs inference-only alongside heuristic rewards. Configurable `--reward-model-weight`, `--reward-model-max-length`, and `--reward-model-template`
- **GRPO speculative decoding** (`--speculative`): Draft/verify rollout generation with 2-4x throughput improvement. Configurable `--speculative-draft-tokens` (default 3). Greedy verification for correctness guarantees
- **GRPO async reward pipelining** (`--async-rewards`): Background reward scoring concurrent with GPU training for ML reward models
- **Cut Cross-Entropy CLI flag** (`--cut-cross-entropy`): Memory-efficient loss computation for SFT training, avoiding full [batch, seq, vocab] logit materialization
- **KL-calibrated GGUF quantization** (`--kl-calibrate`): Per-tensor quantization type selection via NRMSE + cosine distance calibration. `--target-bpw` for budget-constrained quantization, `--kl-threshold` for quality control
- **GRPO TUI form fields**: VLM toggle, speculative decoding, async rewards, ML reward model path, and draft tokens exposed in the interactive TUI
- **Training TUI**: Cut Cross-Entropy toggle added to training tab form

### Fixed

- **Cut Cross-Entropy ignore index panic** (`pmetal-mlx`): `take_axis` with -100 (ignore index) targets caused out-of-bounds gather. Targets are now clamped to valid range before gather; loss masking handles ignored positions
- **Cut Cross-Entropy division by zero** (`pmetal-mlx`): `n_valid=0` (all tokens ignored) caused NaN loss. Guarded with `n_valid.max(1)`
- **Llama LoRA position IDs dropped** (`pmetal-lora`): `forward_hidden_with_positions` silently discarded position IDs, breaking packed-sequence training with non-contiguous positions. Added full position-aware path through attention, decoder layer, and model stack using `apply_rope_with_positions`
- **lm_head weight computed twice per CCE step** (`pmetal-trainer`): Training loop called `lm_head_weight()` for probe and again inside the gradient closure. Weight is now computed once and captured into the closure
- **GRPO VLM pixel_values not replicated per-completion** (`pmetal-trainer`): Images were stacked per-group instead of replicated per-completion, causing batch dimension mismatch. Images now repeat `n_completions` times per group
- **GRPO `run_async` flush skips adaptive LR** (`pmetal-trainer`): Final flush step bypassed adaptive LR, rollback logic, and callbacks. Now applies the same post-step processing as the main loop
- **CoSENT loss overflow with no positive pairs** (`pmetal-trainer`): All-zero labels caused `logsumexp(-1e9)` overflow to `+inf` and `NaN` gradients. Returns `0.0` when no positive pairs exist in the batch
- **LastToken pooling O(batch) GPU syncs** (`pmetal-models`): Per-element `.item()` loop forced one GPU-to-CPU synchronization per batch element. Replaced with vectorized `take_along_axis` + `broadcast_to` for a single gather operation
- **EmbeddingDataset silent empty strings** (`pmetal-data`): Missing text keys (`text_a`/`text_b`) silently produced empty-string training pairs. Now returns an explicit parse error with line number and expected key names
- **BERT `hidden_act` always GELU** (`pmetal-models`): `BertIntermediate::forward` ignored the `hidden_act` config field. Now dispatches to `relu`, `silu`/`swish`, `tanh`, or `gelu` (default) based on config
- **GGUF BPW budget silent non-convergence** (`pmetal-gguf`): `apply_bpw_budget` loop exhausted without warning when all tensors were at minimum quality. Emits `tracing::warn!` when target BPW is unreachable
- **Speculative decode cross-sequence early exit** (`pmetal-models`): Outer generation loop exited when any single sequence hit `max_new_tokens`, truncating other in-progress sequences. Removed `max_generated` check; per-sequence `finished` tracking now controls termination
- **Speculative decode O(seq_len) draft warm-up** (`pmetal-models`): Draft cache was rebuilt from full sequence prefix every step, making total cost O(seq_len^2). Draft caches are now persisted and incrementally advanced with only newly accepted tokens
- **Fused LoRA backward threadgroup memory** (`pmetal-metal`): `fused_lora_backward_a` kernel missing threadgroup memory size check. Added allocation guard with fallback to MLX for large `out_features`
- **LoRA+ double scaling** (`pmetal-lora`): Fused kernel and `AdamWGroups` optimizer could both apply the LoRA+ differential learning rate. Added `kernel_loraplus` flag to prevent double scaling
- **Clippy compliance**: Fixed `field_reassign_with_default` in GGUF calibration summary, `doc_overindented_list_items` in speculative decode docs

### Changed

- **RLKD stats**: Documented that `grpo_component` and `distill_component` in training stats are proportional approximations (`total_loss * (1-alpha)` and `total_loss * alpha`), not true decomposed values
- **Speculative decode bonus token**: Documented that greedy argmax for the bonus token is by design (required for speculative decoding correctness), not a sampling oversight
- **GGUF prefix subsampling**: Expanded documentation warning that prefix subsample assumes i.i.d. weight distribution, which may not hold for structured tensors
- **EmbeddingTrainer**: Added doc warnings that `encode` requires models returning hidden states (not logits) — causal LMs produce `[batch, vocab]` after pooling, which is nonsensical as an embedding

## [0.3.8] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- **Distributed training** (`pmetal-trainer`): Data-parallel gradient synchronization across Apple Silicon clusters via `DistributedGradientSync`. Flatten/all-reduce(Mean)/scatter pipeline with optional gradient compression (fp16, top-k sparsity). Integrated at all 4 training loop sites (run, run_metal_fused, run_jit_compiled, run_packed) with loss sync, epoch barriers, and rank-0-only checkpointing. Feature-gated behind `distributed`
- **Pipeline-parallel inference** (`pmetal-distributed`): Layer-range pipeline parallelism enabling models larger than single-device memory. `ShardableModel` trait decomposes forward pass into embed/apply_layer/normalize/lm_head stages. `PipelineGenerationLoop` for end-to-end autoregressive generation with `StreamMultiplexer` for concurrent request routing
- **Activation transport**: Length-prefixed wire format for hidden state transfer between pipeline stages with fp16 compression codec. `TransportReceiver::recv_vec` for dynamic-size message reception
- **Topology-aware layer assignment**: Proportional (RAM-based) and bandwidth-aware (exhaustive search for 2-3 nodes) solvers with automatic strategy selection based on cluster topology
- **Weight cache**: LRU eviction with reference counting to prevent in-use eviction, per-layer loading, and prefetch support for pipeline stages
- **OpenAI-compatible inference server** (`pmetal-serve`): Drop-in local inference backend with `POST /v1/chat/completions` (streaming SSE and non-streaming), `POST /v1/completions`, `GET /v1/models`, `GET /v1/metrics`, `GET /health`. Chat template auto-detection, stop token collection, and greedy sampling
- **Serving metrics**: Per-request timing (`RequestMetrics`) with first-token latency, total latency, and tok/s. `ServingMetrics` atomic aggregation exposed via `/v1/metrics` endpoint
- **SSE streaming**: Token-by-token Server-Sent Events with role announcement, per-token content deltas, finish_reason, and `[DONE]` sentinel per OpenAI spec
- **Speculative decoding** (`pmetal-models`): Layer-split draft+verify decoder via `SpeculativeDecoder<M: ShardableModel>`. Draft phase uses early layers (default: num_layers/3) for N-token proposals, verify phase runs full model with accept/reject on consecutive matches. `SpeculativeStats` tracks acceptance rate and tokens-per-step
- **f64-accurate LoRA merge** (`pmetal-merge`): Streaming f64 matmul via ndarray for bit-accurate delta computation. Row-by-row fused base+delta+downcast, tiled low-memory path (512-row chunks), bias merging, fan_in_fan_out transpose, overflow clamping before dtype downcast
- **RAM/RAM+ merge method**: Reinforced Agent Merging with unique/shared parameter classification and adaptive tensor-local lambda rescaling
- **Multi-SLERP merge method**: Barycentric spherical interpolation for 3+ models with iterative pairwise SLERP and weight renormalization
- **Frankenmerging config**: `OutputSlice`/`InputSlice` layer-range-based merging with per-slice merge methods, base models, and parameters. `run_merge_sliced()` execution engine with tensor name remapping
- **`ParameterSetting`**: Scalar or conditional (tensor-name filtered) merge parameters enabling per-tensor-type weight variation (attention vs mlp layers)
- **TVD distillation loss**: Total Variation Distance (`0.5 * Σ|P_teacher - P_student|`), bounded [0,1], symmetric proper distance metric
- **Hinge ranking distillation loss**: Pairwise margin-based ranking preservation over top-k teacher tokens with configurable margin
- **Logistic ranking distillation loss**: Softplus-based smooth ranking loss with better gradient flow than hinge, operates on logits for numerical stability
- **CLI `--distributed-peers`, `--distributed-auto`, `--compression-strategy`**: Distributed training flags behind `distributed` feature
- **CLI `pmetal serve --model <path> --port 8080`**: Inference server command behind `serve` feature
- **CLI `--accurate` and `--low-memory`**: Flags for f64 LoRA merge path

### Fixed

- **Alignment violation in distributed gradient sync**: `sync_gradients` and `sync_loss` previously created `Vec<u8>` buffers with align-1, but the ring backend requires align-4 for f32 operations. Fixed by reinterpreting the `Vec<f32>` buffer directly via aligned pointer cast
- **Double-framing deadlock in activation transport**: `serialize()` embedded its own length prefix AND `TransportSender::send()` added another, causing `recv_activation` to misparse messages. Removed embedded prefix; transport layer handles all framing
- **Double EMA on `running_loss` in distributed mode**: Distributed sync block re-applied EMA that `train_step` already applied, causing doubly-decayed loss values for the adaptive LR controller. Removed manual EMA update in distributed block
- **Zero weights in bandwidth-aware layer assignment**: 3+-node fallback computed `(ram / 1M) * (bw / 1M)` which produced zero for small values, causing NaN proportions. Added `.max(1)` guards
- **`argpartition` panic on ranking losses**: `k.min(vocab - 1)` could underflow when vocab=0. Added `.max(0)` guard

### Changed

- **DataLoader sharding**: `rank` and `world_size` fields for modular-arithmetic data partitioning across distributed nodes
- **Merge config system**: `ParameterSetting` type propagated to CLI merge parameter construction, supporting both scalar and conditional forms

## [0.3.7] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- **`pmetal merge` CLI command**: Model merging exposed as a first-class CLI command supporting all merge methods (Linear, SLERP, TIES, DARE, DELLA, NearSwap, Model Stock) with `--method`, `--base`, `--t`, `--weight-a`, `--weight-b`, `--density`, and `--dtype` flags
- **`pmetal eval` CLI command**: Dataset evaluation command — measures loss/perplexity over a validation set with optional LoRA adapter, `--num-samples` cap, and `--json` output
- **`pmetal info` CLI command**: Prints device and runtime information; `--json` flag emits structured JSON for scripting
- **`pmetal search --json` output**: Structured JSON output mode for search results including fit estimates, download counts, parameter estimates, and tags — enables scripting and GUI integration
- **`QuantizeMethod` enum**: Replaces the string `--method` argument for `pmetal quantize` with a typed enum (`dynamic`, `q8_0`, `q4_k_m`, etc.) — invalid methods now fail at argument parsing rather than deep inside the quantizer
- **GRPO CLI arguments**: `--epochs`, `--lora-r`, `--lora-alpha`, `--max-completion-length`, and `--seed` exposed as CLI arguments, replacing previous hardcoded defaults
- **`loraplus_lr_ratio` and `neftune_noise_alpha`**: New fields on training loop configurations — enables LoRA+ differential learning rates and NEFTune noise injection directly from config
- **`trainable_params()` helper**: New utility in `pmetal-lora` for counting total vs. trainable parameter counts, useful for logging and memory estimation
- **`lora_alpha: f32`**: Distillation CLI and `run_distillation_cli` now accept `lora_alpha` as `f32` instead of `usize` for finer-grained scaling control
- **`seed` parameter in distillation and GRPO CLI**: Reproducible runs via explicit `--seed` flag in all training entry points
- **Gemma3 sliding window auto-detection**: `DynamicModel` loader now reads `model_type == "gemma3"` and sets `is_gemma3 = true` on the config, enabling the correct every-6th-layer global attention pattern without manual config overrides
- **KV cache support for more architectures**: `DynamicModel::forward_with_cache` now routes DeepSeek, Cohere, StarCoder2, and Llama4 to their native caching paths; RecurrentGemma and Jamba now get clear error messages that they require `forward()` directly; hybrid models (NemotronH, Qwen3Next) get a descriptive error directing to `forward_with_hybrid_cache`
- **Speculative decoding greedy path**: `SpeculativeDecoder::verify_greedy()` — exact-correct verification for temperature=0 decoding using argmax equality; avoids the numerically unstable rejection-sampling limit as temperature→0
- **Hub cache management** (`pmetal-hub`): New `cache.rs` module with cache inspection, eviction, and size-reporting helpers
- **Shared model utilities** (`pmetal-models/utils.rs`): Common helpers extracted from per-architecture modules to reduce duplication

### Fixed

- **Scale factor broadcasting in distillation**: `squeeze` applied to the scale factor dimension so it broadcasts correctly across batch and sequence axes — previously caused shape mismatches on non-unit batch sizes
- **TAID `mean_alpha` forcing GPU sync**: `TaidLossOutput::mean_alpha` changed from `f32` to a lazy `Array` — the `.eval()` call is deferred until callers explicitly call `.item::<f32>()`, removing a forced GPU-CPU sync before the backward pass
- **SLERP numerical stability**: Added epsilon clamping in the SLERP merge path to prevent NaN when interpolation parameter is at the boundary values (0.0 or 1.0)
- **Llama LoRA `trainable_params` / gradient application**: Replaced 100+ lines of repeated field accesses with an `insert_adapter!` macro and loop over projection names, fixing DoRA `magnitude` parameter that was silently dropped from gradient maps
- **GaLore improvements**: Corrected projection matrix update schedule and subspace dimensionality handling
- **Distillation hidden-state loss**: Refactored alignment computation to correctly handle variable-rank teacher/student hidden state tensors
- **Jensen-Shannon / KL divergence loss**: Numerical stability improvements — log-sum-exp stabilization applied consistently across all reduction paths
- **Offline distillation**: Fixed logit cache loading to handle both single-file and sharded cache layouts

### Changed

- **`lm_groups.rs` / LoRA+ optimizer groups**: `build_lora_param_groups` significantly reworked — LoRA+ differential LR ratio (`loraplus_lr_ratio`) applied to `lora_b` parameters, NEFTune noise injection integrated into group construction
- **GRPO trainer**: `epochs`, `lora_r`, `lora_alpha`, `max_completion_length`, and `seed` plumbed through from CLI args; previously these were hardcoded to `1`, `16`, `32`, `512`, and a fixed seed
- **Training loop**: `loraplus_lr_ratio` and `neftune_noise_alpha` read from config and forwarded to optimizer group construction
- **`pmetal-core` config / scheduler / traits**: Config structs gained `loraplus_lr_ratio` and `neftune_noise_alpha` fields; scheduler types and learning rate trait bounds refined; `TrainingCallback` trait extended with blanket impls for boxed callbacks
- **Data pipeline**: Tokenizer, packing, `vocab_compact`, dataset, and chat template modules updated — minor correctness and efficiency fixes accumulated across the release cycle
- **GGUF reader / writer / quantize**: Reader handles additional tensor metadata fields; writer improves alignment padding; quantize module uses `QuantizeMethod` enum instead of string matching
- **Hub search**: `search_models` returns richer result structs used by both the human-readable table and the new `--json` output path; upload path fixes for large model shards
- **Metal kernels**: GDN, LoRA, grouped GEMM, and fused SwiGLU Metal shaders updated — improved numerical correctness and register pressure
- **GUI app icons and Tauri config**: Updated icons (32×32, 128×128, 128×128@2x, icns, ico) and `tauri.conf.json` for the 0.3.7 release build; Python vocoder `easy` API additions and mel spectrogram fix

## [0.3.6] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- **Desktop GUI (Tauri + Svelte)**: Full desktop application for model management, training, distillation, GRPO, inference, merging, and quantization. 10 pages: Dashboard, Models, Datasets, Training, Distillation, GRPO, Inference, Merging, Quantize, Settings. Real-time training metrics with live loss charts via broadcast events. Model download with HuggingFace Hub integration, dataset browser, and inference chat interface with streaming token display
- **GUI in-process execution**: Training, distillation, GRPO, inference, model merging, LoRA fuse, and quantization run as direct library calls instead of shelling out to the `pmetal` binary. Eliminates binary discovery issues, reduces process overhead, and enables richer progress reporting. Device info and model metadata also read from library APIs
- **`easy::dpo()` / `easy::simpo()` / `easy::orpo()` / `easy::kto()` builders**: `PreferenceTuneBuilder` in `easy.rs` for preference optimization methods. Full pipeline: model download → tokenizer → dataset loading → LoRA setup → training loop → weight saving. Supports method-specific config (DPO beta/loss type, SimPO gamma/CPO, ORPO beta, KTO desirable/undesirable weights)
- **`easy::infer().generate_streaming()`**: Streaming inference API with per-delta callback. Supports both base models and LoRA adapters. Returns `false` from callback to cancel early. ANE fallback emits full result as single delta
- **Preference trainer `train()` methods**: DPO, KTO, ORPO, and SimPO trainers now have self-contained `train()` methods with optimizer integration, batching, epoch loops, callback lifecycle, and metrics collection. Previously only exposed per-step primitives
- **`TrainingCallback::should_stop()`**: Clean cancellation mechanism — callbacks return `true` to request training loop to finish the current step and exit with `Cancelled` error. Checked after every step in all 5 `TrainingLoop::run*` methods, all 4 preference trainer `train()` loops, and `GrpoTrainer::run()`
- **`PMetalError::Cancelled`**: New error variant for clean training cancellation. Corresponding `Cancelled` variants added to `SftError`, `DpoError`, `KtoError`, `OrpoError`, `SimpoError`, and `GrpoError`
- **Preference batch padding utilities**: `pad_u32_sequences`, `pad_i64_sequences`, `pad_f32_sequences` in `preference_batch.rs` for batching variable-length preference pairs
- **NemotronH runtime FP8 quantization**: `quantize_fp8()` converts float weights to FP8 (E4M3) at runtime for all four block types (Mamba, attention, MLP, MoE). Shared helpers `materialize_linear_weight` and `linear_forward_with_optional_fp8` consolidate FP8 dequantization across the model. MoE weights are restacked after quantization for batched dispatch
- **FluxPipeline::from_pretrained**: Load Flux diffusion pipelines from HuggingFace-style model directories. Discovers components via `model_index.json`, parses both native and diffusers-style config keys for CLIP, T5, FluxDiT, and VAE
- **Python training callbacks**: `Trainer.add_callback()` now wires callbacks into the training loop. Built-in `ProgressCallback`, `LoggingCallback`, and `MetricsJsonCallback` map to native Rust implementations; arbitrary Python objects bridge through `PythonCallbackBridge`

### Fixed

- **Training cancellation via `panic_any` replaced**: GUI and TUI previously used `std::panic::panic_any(CancelledRun)` + `catch_unwind` to abort training — fragile, UB-prone through FFI, and could be swallowed by intermediate catch_unwind. Replaced with `TrainingCallback::should_stop()` returning a clean `Err(Cancelled)` from the training loop
- **GUI QLoRA silently failed on non-Llama models**: `run_qlora_training_in_process` hardcoded `LlamaConfig` deserialization, causing confusing errors or silent misconfiguration for Gemma/Qwen/Phi models. Now detects `model_type` from config.json and returns a clear error for unsupported architectures
- **GUI `resume_from` silently ignored**: Training config accepted `resume_from` but discarded it (`let _ = eval`). Now returns an error directing users to the CLI
- **GUI GRPO with no reward function produced noise**: `DummyReward` returning constant 0.1 for all completions made GRPO training meaningless when reasoning rewards were disabled. Now requires explicit reward configuration
- **Preference trainers doubled compute per step**: DPO, KTO, ORPO, and SimPO `train()` methods ran a second full forward pass after the gradient step solely for logging metrics. Replaced with `RefCell` side-channels that capture metric arrays from within the autograd closure — same metrics, zero extra compute
- **Base model thinking mode**: Auto-detect base vs instruct models and disable `<think>` tag prefill for base models. Base models don't understand thinking tags, causing infinite generation without a closing tag
- **Fused model 5x slower than LoRA**: Skip ANE-hybrid path for models under 2B parameters where GPU KV-cache decode is significantly faster (115 vs 20 tok/s). ANE-hybrid benefits larger models where prefill dominates
- **DataLoader panics on bad images**: Replace `panic!()` in VLM batch construction with proper `DataLoaderError` enum and `try_next_batch()` method. Image preprocessing failures and missing-image errors now propagate as `Result` instead of crashing
- **Division by zero with log_every=0**: Clamp `log_every` and `save_every` to minimum 1 across `TrainingLoop`, `LoggingCallback`, `CheckpointCallback`, and CLI
- **LoRA scaling with rank 0**: `LoraConfig::scaling()` returns 0.0 when rank is 0 instead of dividing by zero
- **BF16 LoRA weights**: `sanitize_loaded_weights()` converts BF16 tensors to FP16 since MLX doesn't natively support BF16 on Apple Silicon
- **Qwen3Next silent weight mismatch**: Weight loading now returns errors for unmatched or missing parameters instead of logging a warning and continuing with a partially loaded model
- **Dataset download only fetched README**: `download_dataset()` now enumerates repo files and downloads actual data files (parquet, json, jsonl, csv, arrow, etc.) with split-aware filtering
- **Model download silent failures**: `download_model()` tracks per-file failures and reports them instead of silently skipping failed downloads
- **Flux loading via DynamicModel**: `DynamicModel::load()` for Flux now returns an error directing to `FluxPipeline` instead of incorrectly loading a diffusion model as a causal LM

### Changed

- **GUI architecture: library calls replace subprocess spawning**: Training, distillation, GRPO, inference, merge, fuse, and quantize commands now call `pmetal` library functions directly instead of spawning `pmetal` CLI as a child process. System info reads from `MetalContext::global()` instead of parsing `pmetal memory` stdout. Removes `which` and `futures-util` dependencies
- **TUI direct training execution**: `command_runner.rs` dispatches `train`, `distill`, and `grpo` commands as in-process library calls via `run_direct_command()`, falling back to subprocess for other commands. Training parameters parsed from `CommandSpec` args with `parse_arg`/`required_arg`/`optional_arg` helpers
- **ORPO loss computation refactored**: `compute_orpo_loss_static` now contains the full computation directly instead of creating a throwaway `OrpoTrainer` instance. The instance method `compute_orpo_loss` delegates to it
- **SimPO gradient-safe loss path**: New `compute_loss_with_cpo_for_grad` static method keeps the computation graph lazy (no `.eval()`/`.item()` calls) for correct autograd. The existing `compute_loss_with_cpo` remains for non-grad contexts
- **`FinetuneBuilder` expanded**: New builder methods — `lora_dropout()`, `use_rslora()`, `use_dora()`, `gradient_checkpointing_layers()`, `callback()`, `metrics_path()`. LoRA config now forwards dropout, RSLoRA, and DoRA settings
- **GRPO CLI gains new parameters**: `epochs`, `lora_r`, `lora_alpha`, `max_completion_length` exposed as CLI arguments and TUI form fields. GRPO now saves `adapter_config.json` alongside LoRA weights
- **CLI `emit_console_output` flag**: Training, distillation, and GRPO CLI functions accept `emit_console_output: bool` and `extra_callbacks: Vec<Box<dyn TrainingCallback>>` to suppress terminal output when called from GUI/TUI
- **DataLoader error handling**: New `DataLoaderError` enum with `Mlx`, `ImagePreprocess`, and `MissingImages` variants. All 7 training loop entry points migrated from `next_batch()` to `try_next_batch()`
- **AdapterManager validation**: `load()` now validates path existence, checks for adapter artifacts in directories, and rejects unsupported file types
- **Metal shader build isolation**: Shader compiler cache redirected to build output directory, preventing pollution of user's home directory
- **unsafe_code lint scoping**: Moved blanket `#![allow(unsafe_code)]` from crate-level `lib.rs` into individual modules that contain unsafe blocks across pmetal-metal, pmetal-mlx, pmetal-models, pmetal-trainer, pmetal-distill, and pmetal-distributed

## [0.3.5] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- **Tool/function calling support**: Chat templates now support tool definitions and tool call formatting for models that natively support function calling:
  - **Qwen/ChatML**: `<tools>` schema injection, `<tool_call>`/`<tool_response>` tags, consecutive tool message merging
  - **Llama 3.1+/4**: `Environment: ipython` header, JSON function calls, `ipython` role for tool responses
  - **Mistral v3+**: `[AVAILABLE_TOOLS]`/`[TOOL_CALLS]`/`[TOOL_RESULTS]` bracketed format
  - **DeepSeek**: Qwen-style tool tags with DeepSeek's unicode tokens
  - CLI: `pmetal infer --tools tools.json -p "What's the weather?"` accepts OpenAI-format tool definitions
- **Tool calling types**: `ToolDefinition`, `ToolCall`, `FunctionCall`, `FunctionDefinition` — OpenAI-compatible structs with serde support for JSON parsing
- **`Message` tool fields**: `tool_calls: Option<Vec<ToolCall>>` for assistant messages, `tool_call_id: Option<String>` for tool response messages, `Message::tool()` and `Message::assistant_tool_calls()` constructors
- **`ChatTemplate::apply_with_tools()`**: New method accepting optional `&[ToolDefinition]` — injects tools into system prompts using model-native format

### Fixed

- **Premature early stop during LoRA training**: The adaptive LR controller was falsely detecting "divergence" from the normal LoRA initialization loss rise (LoRA B starts at zero → first 5-10% of steps naturally increase loss). This triggered rollback cycles that exhausted `max_rollbacks` and killed training at ~5% progress. Fixed with three changes:
  - **Grace period** (`warmup_fraction: 0.1`): No spike/plateau/divergence detection fires during the first 10% of training steps. EMA and loss window still accumulate during this period so detection is primed when it activates
  - **Rollback disabled by default** (`rollback_enabled: false`): Weight rollback undoes valid LoRA weight updates and causes the same initialization pattern to repeat. Now opt-in for long pre-training runs
  - **Less sensitive thresholds**: `divergence_slope_threshold` 0.01 → 0.05, `divergence_window` 20 → 40, `plateau_patience` 50 → 100, `spike_threshold` 3.0 → 3.5
- **Adaptive LR grace period not applied**: `set_total_steps()` is now called by all 7 training entry points (5 in `TrainingLoop`, 1 in `GrpoTrainer`, 1 in `DistillationTrainer`) to compute the grace period from total steps

### Changed

- **Adaptive LR defaults**: Retuned for LoRA fine-tuning rather than pre-training. The controller now acts as a safety net (catches NaN, true catastrophic divergence) rather than an aggressive optimizer
- **Distillation adaptive LR**: `for_distillation()` config uses shorter 5% grace period (distillation has smoother early loss) and tighter divergence thresholds

## [0.3.4] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- **Mixture-of-Depths (MoD)** for Llama 4: Proper implementation per Raposo et al. (2024) — lightweight router with `argpartition_axis` top-k, gather-before-compute on sub-batch, scatter-after, BCE auxiliary loss. Configurable capacity factor and per-layer selection
- **Llama 4 RoPE**: Real RoPE implementation via `pmetal_mlx::kernels::rope::apply_rope` (Metal-accelerated), replacing the placeholder stub. Correctly wired into iRoPE layer dispatch — RoPE layers get rotary embeddings, NoPE layers skip them
- **Llama 4 temperature scaling**: Per Meta's formula `log(floor((pos+1)/floor_scale) + 1) * attn_scale + 1.0`, applied to Q states in NoPE layers before QK matmul for long-context attention stabilization
- **Llama 4 GQA**: KV-head broadcast expansion for grouped-query attention — enables Scout (40 Q / 8 KV) and Maverick configs
- **MoE top-k > 1**: `Llama4Router` uses `argpartition_axis` for O(n) expert selection with L1-normalized weights and per-slot dispatch loop, replacing hardcoded argmax
- **ANE fused kernels**: `gen_dynamic_sdpa_fwd` (single-kernel attention: RMSNorm + QKV + SDPA + Wo) and `gen_dynamic_ffn_w13` (single-kernel FFN: RMSNorm + W1 + W3 + SiLU), replacing 6+ separate ANE evaluations per layer
- **ANE fused backward**: `gen_dynamic_ffn_bwd_w2t` and `gen_dynamic_ffn_bwd_w13t` for fused FFN backward pass
- **Metal dequantization kernels**: Q4_0 and IQ4_XS Metal compute shaders, verified correct per GGML spec. Bridge methods in `MlxMetalBridge` for GPU-accelerated dequantization
- **Cancellation safety infrastructure**: `CompletionToken::Drop` guard in `AsyncScheduler` waits for in-flight GPU commands; `retain_resource()` / `as_retained()` for Metal buffer lifetime extension
- **IoSurface helpers**: `write_f32_strided_at`, `write_f32_at_col_offset`, `zero_channel_range_f32` for fused backward kernel IO
- **CloudBridge**: Complete training state export (weights, optimizer state, RNG, dataloader position, metadata) with working Python bootstrap scripts for FSDP/DeepSpeed cluster resumption and Rust-side loader functions
- **Formal verification**: `cargo-kani` proofs for ring all-reduce chunk arithmetic (95 checks) and k-ary tree topology consistency (607 checks), with justfile recipes
- **Reasoning templates**: `MathReasoningTemplate` (GRPO + accuracy/format rewards) and `CodeReasoningTemplate` (structural code fence + test case matching)
- **Reasoning dataset auto-detection**: `pmetal dataset prepare` automatically detects `problem`/`thinking`/`solution` columns and formats them as `<think>` tagged ChatML conversations
- **`--columns` flag**: General column remapping for `dataset prepare` (e.g., `--columns "instruction=question,output=answer"`)
- **`adapter_config.json`**: Saved alongside LoRA weights during training (r, alpha, target_modules, use_rslora). Loaded automatically at inference and fuse time — eliminates config guesswork
- **Supply chain**: `cargo-vet` initialized with Mozilla, Google, and Bytecode Alliance audit imports; 17 workspace crates covered; 5 transitive dependency exemptions with exact lockfile versions
- **Tracing spans**: 6 `info_span!` markers in Python trainer for phase-level observability (model_resolve, load_tokenizer, load_dataset, load_model, training_loop, save_weights)

### Fixed

- **LoRA inference garbage output**: Merged LoRA weights into base model at inference time (`W += scale*B@A`), matching mlx-lm's pattern. The separate-forward path had dtype mismatch issues (BF16 base × F32 LoRA)
- **Auto-chat mode regression**: Removed heuristic that forced chat template on base models just because their tokenizer has `<|im_end|>`. Chat mode now requires explicit `--chat` or an instruction-tuned model
- **Missing EOS in training data**: Training sequences now end with the model's actual EOS token (e.g., `<|endoftext|>` for Qwen). Previously only had turn delimiter (`<|im_end|>`) — model never learned to stop generating
- **Fuse command wrong alpha/rank**: `pmetal fuse` now reads `adapter_config.json` for correct alpha and rank instead of defaulting to `scale=1.0`. Also filters MLP LoRA weights (rank=0) when auto-detecting rank from shapes
- **ANE `x2norm` backward bug**: FFN weight gradients (`dW1`, `dW3`) were computed against the wrong pre-norm tensor (`xnorm` from attention block instead of `x2norm` from FFN block). Restored `x2norm` field and CPU RMSNorm recomputation for gradient correctness
- **ANE `sdpa_bwd` surface dtype**: Backward SDPA output surfaces were allocated as fp32 but ANE kernels produce fp16 — stride mismatch corrupted dV/dQ/dK gradients. Fixed to `IoSurface::for_tensor()` (fp16)
- **MoD argpartition sign**: Router negated weights before `argpartition_axis`, selecting bottom-k (least important) tokens instead of top-k. Removed negation
- **MLX bridge `copy_as_f32` regression**: Renamed methods dropped auto dtype conversion — callers passing wrong dtype would panic. Restored `copy_as_f32` / `copy_as_f16` with auto-conversion
- **MLX bridge `view_f32` eval**: Removed `.eval()` call before accessing data pointer — unevaluated arrays returned null. Restored defensive eval
- **Python API surface**: Restored `ProgressCallback`, `LoggingCallback(log_every=10)`, `__version__`, and `PythonCallbackBridge` that were deleted during PyO3 migration
- **TUI training completion**: Reads final metrics from JSONL file on disk (immune to polling lag). Shows actual loss and step count instead of `0.0000` / sample count
- **TUI Steps/min overflow**: Guards against divide-by-zero when `total_ms=0` — shows `—` instead of `60000`
- **Dataset prepare panic**: Empty results no longer crash with index-out-of-bounds. Shows diagnostic message with format hints

### Changed

- **LoRA inference uses merge**: `merge_lora()` is called before generation, producing a single merged weight matrix per layer. This is equivalent to the fuse command but happens in-memory without saving
- **PyO3 0.23 → 0.28**: `allow_threads` → `detach`, `with_gil` → `attach`, `from_py_object` on all pyclass types, `Bound<'py, PyDict>` return types
- **tokio 1.49 → 1.50**
- **`unsafe_code` lint**: Escalated from `warn` to `deny` workspace-wide

## [0.3.3] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **Self-contained binary**: `mlx.metallib` is now gzip-compressed and embedded into the `pmetal` binary at build time via `build.rs` + `include_bytes!`. On first run it extracts to `~/.cache/pmetal/lib/` if not already present. `cargo install pmetal-cli` now produces a fully self-contained binary with no external metallib dependency (~31MB added to binary, 70% smaller than the raw 102MB metallib)
- **Adaptive LR rollback**: When divergence is detected and `rollback_enabled = true`, the adaptive LR controller emits `LrEvent::RollbackTriggered` — the training loop restores LoRA weights from the best in-memory EMA snapshot, resets optimizer momentum, and continues with a halved LR multiplier
- **Early-stop on repeated divergence**: After `max_rollbacks` exhausted rollbacks, the controller emits `LrEvent::EarlyStop` — the training loop saves a final checkpoint and exits cleanly instead of spiraling deeper into loss divergence
- **In-memory LoRA snapshot**: `TrainingLoop` holds the best LoRA weight snapshot in RAM via `snapshot_best_weights()` / `restore_best_weights()`. LoRA params are typically 1–20 MB, making this negligible overhead vs checkpoint I/O
- **`AdaptiveAction` enum**: `apply_adaptive_lr()` now returns `AdaptiveAction::Continue | Rollback | EarlyStop` so training loops can react to controller decisions without re-parsing event strings

### Fixed

- **`apply_adaptive_lr` return type**: Previously returned `()`, discarding rollback/early-stop events — callers had no way to react. Now returns `AdaptiveAction`
- **Divergence rollback vs plain reduction ambiguity**: Divergence path now checks `rollback_enabled` and `has_best_snapshot` before deciding between rollback and plain LR reduction — prevents silent rollback when no snapshot exists
- **EMA state reset on rollback**: Spike EMA and variance are reset alongside LR multiplier on rollback so z-score anomaly detection re-stabilizes correctly after weight restoration
- **`total_steps` in metrics**: `run_standard()` and `run_jit_compiled()` computed `total_steps: max_steps.unwrap_or(0)` — now estimates from `dataset.len() / batch_size * epochs` when `max_steps` is `None`, giving accurate progress in the TUI
- **`stats_summary` missing rollback count**: `AdaptiveLrController::stats_summary()` now includes `rollbacks=N` in its output string

### Improved

- **Rollback tests**: Four new unit tests — `test_rollback_triggered_on_divergence`, `test_early_stop_after_max_rollbacks`, `test_rollback_disabled_falls_through_to_divergence`, `test_should_snapshot_best_tracks_ema_improvement`

## [0.3.2] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **Adaptive learning rate controller**: EMA-based z-score spike detection, patience-based plateau detection, and linear regression divergence detection — automatically adjusts LR multiplier during training to recover from loss spikes, reduce LR on plateaus, and halt on divergence
- **Manual LR override via TUI**: Press `L` in Training, Distillation, or GRPO tabs to set a custom learning rate mid-run; uses atomic control file protocol (`{output_dir}/.lr_control.json`) for safe subprocess communication
- **WSD (Warmup-Stable-Decay) scheduler**: New `LrSchedulerType::Wsd` with configurable `stable_ratio` — holds peak LR for a plateau phase before linear decay, popular for large-scale pretraining
- **GRPO adaptive LR + callbacks**: `GrpoTrainer` now supports adaptive LR, `TrainingCallback` lifecycle events, and `StepMetrics` emission for live TUI monitoring
- **HuggingFace Hub search** (`pmetal search`): CLI command and TUI integration (press `S` in Models tab) to search HF Hub for text-generation models with download counts, parameter estimates, and memory fit assessment
- **Memory fit estimation**: New `pmetal-hub` module estimates inference/training memory requirements, tok/s throughput, and color-coded fit levels (green/yellow/red) based on device specs and model architecture
- **Model detail panel**: Models tab shows memory breakdown — weights, KV cache, overhead, training estimate, and recommended batch size
- **Distillation metrics callbacks**: `DistillationTrainer` now emits step-by-step metrics via `TrainingCallback`, enabling live TUI dashboard during distillation runs
- **Command logging in Jobs tab**: Spawned commands are logged with the full CLI invocation for easier debugging

### Fixed

- **NaN/Inf loss guard**: Adaptive LR skips EMA updates on non-finite losses to prevent EMA poisoning — returns scheduled LR unchanged
- **EMA variance bias correction**: Early-training z-scores now use bias-corrected variance (`raw_var / (1 - alpha^n)`), matching Adam's moment correction — prevents false spike detection in first ~20 steps
- **Zero-variance z-score fallback**: When loss variance is near zero (std_dev < 1e-8), uses absolute deviation threshold instead of division-by-zero; returns z=10 for >50% deviation, z=0 otherwise
- **Atomic control file protocol**: LR control file is renamed to `.lr_control.claimed` before reading and deleted after — prevents race conditions between TUI writer and training subprocess reader
- **Distillation metrics LR**: Distillation step metrics now report post-adaptive LR instead of pre-adjustment scheduled LR
- **Adaptive LR in all training paths**: `apply_adaptive_lr()` now called in `run_metal_fused()`, `run_compiled()`, `run_jit_compiled()`, and `run_packed()` paths (was only in `run_standard()`)
- **TUI LR override validation**: LR range check now accepts 1.0 (was exclusive upper bound); shows error modal on invalid input instead of silent log warning
- **Distillation/GRPO job routing**: Status updates were always routed to the Training tab regardless of job type. Added `active_job_type` tracking to route metrics, completion, and failure to the correct tab (Distill, GRPO, or Training)
- **Distillation CLI args**: TUI sent `--lora-alpha` and `--log-metrics` flags that the CLI didn't accept, causing immediate exit code 2. Added both args to the `Distill` command and `--log-metrics` to `Grpo`
- **Parquet dataset support in distill/GRPO**: Distillation and GRPO commands only supported JSONL datasets. Now auto-detect `.parquet` files and route to the parquet loader, matching the training command's behavior
- **Tab click targeting**: Mouse clicks on Monitor, Inference, and Jobs tabs selected the wrong tab due to hardcoded fixed-width hit-testing. Now computes actual tab widths from rendered text
- **Error diagnostics**: Failed jobs now show the last 5 stderr lines in the tab status panel instead of just "Process exited with code N", with a hint to check the Jobs tab for full output
- **UTF-8 safe string truncation**: `truncate_str` used byte indexing which panics on multi-byte characters; switched to `chars()` iterator
- **Leaked channel in HF search**: `search_hf()` created a sender/receiver pair even without a CommandRunner, silently dropping results
- **Integer overflow in fit estimation**: `estimate_params_from_config` used plain multiplication; switched to `saturating_mul`/`saturating_add`
- **Context length truncation**: u64→u32 cast could wrap for extreme values; capped at 1M before cast

### Improved

- **TUI tab ordering**: System (formerly Device) is now the default first tab; Dashboard renamed to Monitor
- **Empty state messaging**: Monitor tab shows actionable guidance ("Start a run from Training, Distill, or GRPO tab") instead of "Waiting for training data..."
- **Idle state hint**: Tabs show "Press S to start" instead of "Press S to start training" (generic across all job types)

### Security

- **Bounded API responses**: `bounded_json()` caps HF API response bodies at 4MB to prevent heap exhaustion
- **Model ID validation**: `is_valid_model_id()` rejects path traversal, URL injection, and malformed values in HF API paths

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **M5 / Apple10 device detection**: GPU family `Apple10` with architecture generation 17, NAX (Neural Accelerators in GPU) availability flag, and NAX-aware tile size tuning (M5 Max/Ultra get 128×64×32)
- **UltraFusion topology detection**: `sysctl hw.packages` detects multi-die Ultra chips; `is_ultra_fusion` and `die_count` fields on `DeviceProperties`
- **GPU and ANE core count estimation**: Per-chip core counts derived from device name and tier, with UltraFusion die multiplication
- **Memory bandwidth estimation**: Tier + GPU family lookup table for estimated bandwidth (GB/s)
- **ANE performance stats API**: `evaluate_with_stats()` on `AneModel` uses `_ANEPerformanceStats` with `hwExecutionTime` for nanosecond-precision hardware timing
- **TUI device tab enhancements**: GPU core counts (with per-die breakdown for Ultra), ANE core counts, memory bandwidth, architecture generation, NAX and UltraFusion feature flags
- **`crates/pmetal/README.md`**: Crate-level README with feature flags table, quick start examples, hardware support summary, and re-export reference

### Fixed

- **`AppleGPUFamily::Unknown` ordering bug**: `Unknown` was declared last in the enum, causing derived `Ord` to rank it above `Apple10` — unknown GPUs incorrectly got `has_dynamic_caching`, `has_nax`, etc. set to `true`. Fixed by moving `Unknown` to first position
- **Future chip name collision**: `name.contains("M1")` matched "M10"; replaced with `has_chip_id()` that checks the character after the match isn't a digit
- **Dead `sysctl` subprocess in `query_memory_bandwidth`**: Spawned `sysctl` whose result was discarded; removed and renamed to `estimate_memory_bandwidth()` using tier-based lookup

### Improved

- **README updates**: Root README now documents hardware support matrix (M1–M5), 9 TUI tabs (was 7), 16 crates (was 15), all fused Metal kernels (GDN, SwiGLU, RMSNorm+LoRA), ANE perf stats and M1–M5 compatibility
- **Hardware support docs**: Complete M1–M5 chip matrix with arch gen, core counts, bandwidth, ANE TFLOPS measurements; NAX kernel integration roadmap; UltraFusion distributed roadmap

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- **TUI Control Center** (`pmetal tui`): Full terminal interface with 9 tabs — Dashboard, Device, Models, Datasets, Training, Distillation, GRPO, Inference, Jobs. Async event loop with crossterm/ratatui, modal system (confirm, text input, model picker, dataset picker, error, progress), and reusable form field widgets
- **Live job integration**: Training, distillation, and GRPO tabs spawn pmetal subprocesses and stream metrics in real time via `CommandRunner` + JSONL polling
- **LoRA fuse command** (`pmetal fuse`): Merge LoRA adapter weights into base model, with optional fuse-then-quantize pipeline
- **Chat template support for Llama 4, DeepSeek, and Cohere**: Full template formatting, Jinja detection, model name heuristics, stop tokens, and inference formatting for all three model families
- **Llama 4 template**: `<|header_start|>`/`<|header_end|>`/`<|eot|>` tokens (distinct from Llama 3's `<|start_header_id|>`/`<|end_header_id|>`/`<|eot_id|>`)
- **DeepSeek template**: Full-width unicode tokens (`<｜begin▁of▁sentence｜>`, `<｜User｜>`, `<｜Assistant｜>`) with thinking mode support (`<think>`/`</think>` prefill)
- **Cohere Command R template**: `<|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>`, `<|USER_TOKEN|>`, `<|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>`, `<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>` tokens
- **Comprehensive stop token collection**: `collect_all_stop_tokens()` now probes 11 well-known special tokens across all model families (added `<|eot|>`, `<|end|>`, `<|return|>`, `<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>`, `<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>`)
- **LoRA inference auto-chat detection**: Probes vocabulary for `<|im_end|>`/`<|eot_id|>` to auto-enable chat mode on base models fine-tuned with LoRA
- **Streaming generation support**: `GenerationConfig` streaming extensions in `pmetal-models`
- **Epoch/total_steps in StepMetrics**: Training progress now flows through entire pipeline (training loop → JSONL callback → TUI) showing step X/Y and epoch M/N
- **Hardware support documentation**: Apple Silicon hardware matrix and tuning reference (`docs/hardware-support.md`)

### Fixed

- **TUI inference word wrap**: Model output now wraps correctly within the terminal width instead of clipping off-screen; `normalize_code_fences()` preprocessor ensures ``` markers always appear on their own line even when the model emits text without newlines
- **TUI inference code block rendering**: Fenced code blocks (```python, etc.) now render properly with distinct styling even when the token stream lacks explicit newline characters
- **TUI UTF-8 safe text handling**: Word wrap and code block truncation now use char-count width instead of byte length, preventing panics on multi-byte characters
- **GRPO accuracy reward — last-occurrence extraction**: `AccuracyReward` now uses `rfind()` for `<answer>` tags and `\boxed{}`, correctly grabbing the final answer when the model retries within chain-of-thought
- **GRPO accuracy reward — broken fallback**: Old code compared the entire completion (including reasoning) against the answer when no `<answer>` tags were found; now falls back to last non-empty line
- **GRPO accuracy reward — whitespace normalization**: Answer comparison now collapses internal whitespace runs to single space, preventing false negatives from formatting differences
- **LoRA inference stop tokens**: `run_inference_with_lora` now uses full chat template + comprehensive stop token collection instead of just tokenizer EOS — fixes infinite generation on chat-finetuned models
- **LoRA inference missing parameters**: All sampling parameters (top_k, top_p, min_p, penalties, seed) now passed through to LoRA inference path
- **Llama 4 misdetection**: Model name heuristic now correctly routes `llama-4`/`llama4` to Llama 4 template (was incorrectly using Llama 3 tokens)

### Added

- **GRPO `\boxed{}` answer extraction**: `AccuracyReward` now extracts answers from LaTeX `\boxed{...}` expressions with brace-depth tracking, standard for math GRPO (DeepSeek-R1 style)

### Improved

- **TUI replaces legacy dashboard**: `pmetal tui` provides full control center; legacy `pmetal dashboard` retained for simple metrics monitoring
- **Chat template Jinja detection**: Ordered detection ensures DeepSeek (full-width unicode), Cohere, Llama 4 are matched before generic patterns
- **EOS token stripping**: `strip_eos_tokens()` now handles all model-family EOS tokens

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Cross-vocabulary distillation**: Sparse top-k alignment (k=128) enables teacher/student with different vocab sizes; implemented in KL divergence, soft cross-entropy, and Jensen-Shannon losses
- **Fused GDN Metal kernel**: Gated Delta Network forward pass for Qwen 3.5 hybrid layers (`fused_gdn.metal` + `fused_gdn.rs`)
- **Gated delta MLX kernel**: Forward and backward passes for GDN in `pmetal-mlx`
- **CPU RMSNorm for ANE inference**: Compute RMSNorm on CPU in f32 to avoid fp16 overflow/saturation on ANE; per-head QK-norm stays on ANE where values are safe
- **`cpu_rmsnorm` flag in kernel generators**: `gen_sdpa_fwd_kv()` and `gen_ffn_fwd()` accept `cpu_rmsnorm: bool` — when true, emits identity instead of RMSNorm and omits weight blobs
- **Test serialization config**: `.cargo/config.toml` sets `RUST_TEST_THREADS=1` to prevent MLX GPU memory races

### Fixed

- **ANE inference garbage output**: fp16 `reduce_sum(x², axis=channel)` overflows for residual values > 256 due to ANE saturation arithmetic; CPU RMSNorm in f32 eliminates the corruption
- **Cross-vocab distillation crash**: Mismatched teacher/student vocab sizes (e.g., Qwen3-4B 151,936 → Qwen3.5-0.8B 152,080) no longer panic; `align_vocab()` handles alignment transparently
- **3D tensor indexing in `align_vocab`**: Use `(Ellipsis, ..k)` for correct last-axis slicing of rank-3+ tensors
- **Qwen 3.5 (1+w) RMSNorm**: Weight sanitization adds 1.0 to RMSNorm weights during loading
- **Clippy lints**: Unnecessary parentheses in `fused_gdn.rs`, too-many-arguments on `rmsnorm_backward`, let-and-return in `next_power_of_2`

### Improved

- **ANE inference cleanup**: Removed ~80 lines of diagnostic logging from hot path
- **Metal GPU path gating**: Cross-vocab losses gate Metal GPU path on matching vocabs, fall back to CPU for mismatched
- **Documentation**: Updated all crate READMEs to reflect current architecture support, training methods, and features

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- **Apple Neural Engine (ANE) integration** behind `ane` feature flag — MIL 1.3 program generation, private API FFI via dlopen, IOSurface zero-copy, compilation budget tracking, hybrid CPU/ANE trainer with async gradient accumulation
- **`AneInferenceEngine`** — forward-only ANE kernels (no concat taps, ~6x smaller IO vs training) with CPU-side embedding, RMSNorm, sampling (greedy/temperature/top-k), and autoregressive generation via Easy API `.device(Device::Ane)`
- **KV cache for autoregressive generation** — hybrid ANE prefill + CPU decode architecture eliminates O(n²×L) recomputation per token; ANE processes the full prompt, CPU handles single-token decode steps with cached KV pairs via `cblas_sgemv`
- **GQA/MQA support** — `n_kv_heads` config field enables grouped-query attention (Llama 3, Mistral, etc.); concat-based KV head expansion in ANE kernels
- **SafeTensors weight loading** — direct loading of HuggingFace safetensors format (single and multi-file) with automatic bf16/f16/f32 dtype conversion
- **LoRA adapter fusion** — merge adapter weights (`W += (alpha/rank) * B @ A`) before ANE kernel compilation; supports both `self_attn` and `mlp` target modules
- **Dynamic weight pipeline**: 9 MIL kernels compiled once at startup; weights packed alongside activations in IOSurface spatial dimension — zero recompilation during training
- **`DynamicAneTrainer`**: compile-once training loop replacing the static trainer that consumed ~76% of training time in recompilation
- **`DynamicKernelConfig`** and 12 dynamic kernel generators in `dynamic_kernel.rs`
- **MIL program fragment helpers**: `emit_rmsnorm_fuse` and `emit_dyn_matmul_with_act` for composable RMSNorm fusion and dynamic matmul in ANE kernel generation
- **`rmsnorm_fwd` dynamic kernel**: Fused RMSNorm forward pass on ANE
- **fp32 IOSurface support**: `IoSurface::new_f32()` with packed write/read for dynamic weight pipeline
- **MIL builder extensions**: `emit_cast`, `emit_slice_by_size`, `new_fp32_input` for dynamic kernel generation
- **Non-standard `head_dim` support**: Full forward and backward kernel support for models where `head_dim != dim/n_heads` (e.g., Qwen3 with `head_dim=128`, `dim/n_heads=64`)
- **Training dashboard (TUI)**: `pmetal dashboard` subcommand using ratatui for real-time loss curves, timing breakdown, and throughput monitoring
- **`MetricsJsonCallback`**: Emits full `StepMetrics` including ANE timing, Adam timing, and throughput to JSONL
- **GSPO trainer**: Group Sequence Policy Optimization (fixes GRPO length bias)
- **DAPO trainer**: Decoupled Clip and Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (all 4 ByteDance innovations)
- **Python bindings** (`pmetal-py`) via PyO3/maturin with type stubs
- **High-level Easy API** (`pmetal::easy`) — builder pattern for fine-tuning and inference
- **Version and device introspection** (`pmetal::version`)
- **Examples**: `device_info`, `finetune_easy`, `finetune_manual`, `inference_easy`
- **Python CI workflow** (`.github/workflows/python.yml`)
- `Device::Ane` variant with feature-gated support
- ANE-specific error types in `pmetal-core` and `pmetal-metal`
- ANE training loop integration in `pmetal-trainer`
- `silu_inplace` in Accelerate wrappers for CPU decode SwiGLU

### Fixed

- **Metal resource exhaustion on long training runs**: `eval_training_state()` now evaluates model params and optimizer states (momentum, velocity) alongside losses, preventing unbounded computation graph growth in deferred-eval mode
- **Gradient checkpointing default**: `CheckpointStrategy` default changed from `Smart` to `None` — MLX backend does not implement it yet; configs remain forward-compatible
- **Training defaults**: batch_size default 4→1, gradient_accumulation_steps default 1→4 (same effective batch size, lower per-step memory pressure)
- ANE inference gibberish output: added RoPE and per-head QK-norm to prefill kernel and CPU decode
- ANE inference missing `compile_kernels()` call in `generate_cached_ane`
- All backward kernels (static + dynamic) now use `q_dim()`/`kv_dim()` instead of hardcoded `dim` — fixes incorrect gradient shapes for non-standard architectures
- `sdpa_bwd1_input_ch`: `4*dim` → `q_dim + 2*kv_dim + dim`
- `sdpa_bwd1_output_ch`: `dim + 2*score_ch` → `kv_dim + 2*score_ch`
- `sdpa_bwd2_input_ch`: `2*score_ch + 2*dim` → `2*score_ch + q_dim + kv_dim`
- Dynamic backward kernels: `wo_bwd`, `sdpa_bwd1`, `sdpa_bwd2`, `qkv_bwd` all updated for q_dim/kv_dim
- SafeTensors dtype/alignment error handling
- Token ID bounds check in CPU decode
- Softmax numerical stability for zero-sum edge case
- ANE GQA inference failure (`status=0x1d`): replaced unreliable `tile` MIL op with concat-based KV head expansion in all 3 SDPA kernels
- Token ID truncation: `embed_lookup`/`embed_backward` changed from `u16` to `u32` (Qwen3 vocab=151936 exceeds u16 max)
- RMSNorm epsilon hardcoded to 1e-5: now configurable via `cfg.rms_norm_eps` (Qwen3 requires 1e-6)
- CI: Exclude `pmetal-py` from CI clippy/build/test (requires Python dev libs not available on runner)

### Improved

- NEON f16↔f32 conversion upgraded from 4-wide to 8-wide (`fcvtn2`/`fcvtl2`)
- Accelerate/vDSP wrappers expanded with 12 new functions: `rmsnorm`, `rmsnorm_backward`, `cross_entropy_loss`, `softmax_inplace`, `adam_update`, `embed_lookup`, `embed_backward`, `matrix_transpose`, `gemm`, `vadd`, `vmul` (with scalar fallbacks on non-macOS)
- `supports_neural_engine()` now performs real ANE detection via framework dlopen
- Easy API ANE path now auto-detects SafeTensors/flat weights, LoRA adapters, and GQA config; uses `generate_cached()` for KV-cached inference
- ANE config validation (`new()` returns `Result`)
- Kernel config validation (`TransformerKernelConfig::validate()`)
- LoRA safety: rank=0 guard and tensor shape validation
- Decode memory efficiency: pooled scores buffer
- 15 new tests for non-standard head_dim kernels (7 static + 8 dynamic)
- MIL debug dump on ANE compile failure (`/tmp/ane_debug_layer{N}_{attn|ffn}.mil`)
- Qwen3 GQA kernel test (n_heads=16, n_kv_heads=8, verifies no `tile` ops)
- Dynamic kernel documentation: All 12 kernels now document detailed input tensor names alongside dimension formulas

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed

- **GPU occupancy waste in gradient scaling**: `scale_gradients` grid dispatch was 4x over-provisioned after float4/half4 vectorization — each thread processes 4 elements but the grid still dispatched one thread per element; corrected from `div_ceil(32)` to `div_ceil(128)`
- **Threadgroup memory overallocation in fused LoRA**: Static `threadgroup float[128 * 256]` arrays in `fused_lora_forward` and `fused_lora_backward_x` allocated 128KB each, exceeding Apple Silicon's 32KB threadgroup memory limit; switched to dynamic threadgroup memory via `setThreadgroupMemoryLength` with host-side size calculation based on actual tile and rank dimensions
- **Silent loss of final async checkpoint**: When `TrainingLoop` was dropped, the pending background checkpoint thread was silently detached — if the process exited before the thread finished, the final safetensors file could be truncated or corrupt; added `Drop` impl that joins the pending handle and logs errors
- **LoRA rank validation**: Raised rank limit from 64 to 256 to match `MAX_LORA_RANK` now that dynamic threadgroup memory removes the static allocation constraint

### Improved

- **Checkpoint I/O deduplication**: Extracted shared file write logic (`write_checkpoint_to_dir`) from `save_checkpoint`, `save_checkpoint_owned`, and `save_best_checkpoint` — eliminated ~100 lines of duplicated directory creation, safetensors serialization, and metadata JSON writes
- **Edge case test coverage**: Added tests for NEON fp16↔fp32 conversion (NaN, Inf, -Inf, -0.0, subnormals, exact 4-element alignment, 1M+ element arrays) and Accelerate vDSP wrappers (negative values, single-element arrays, 1M+ element arrays)

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-27

### Improved

- **Unified chat template detection**: New `detect_chat_template()` inspects `tokenizer_config.json` Jinja strings before falling back to model-name heuristics — training, inference, and distillation now detect templates consistently
- **Broader inference templates**: Added inference formatters for Llama-2, Gemma, Mistral, Phi-3, Phi-4, and GPT-OSS (previously only ChatML and Llama-3 were supported)
- **Template-aware stop tokens**: Inference now encodes the correct EOS token per template type (`<|eot_id|>` for Llama-3, `<end_of_turn>` for Gemma, etc.) instead of hardcoding `<|im_end|>`
- **Array chat_template support**: Handles HuggingFace models that store `chat_template` as an array of `{name, template}` objects (e.g., Command-R)
- **Distillation template detection**: Distillation now applies the student model's chat template during dataset formatting (was `None` before)
- **Distillation completion output**: Summary box with detected template and actionable next-steps command

### Fixed

- **Silent download failures**: Tokenizer and config file download errors now logged with `warn!`/`debug!` instead of silently swallowed with `let _ =`
- **Silent quantize fallback**: Invalid `--method` values now produce a clear error listing valid methods instead of silently falling back to Q4K
- **Dataset directory error**: Passing a directory to `--dataset` now auto-discovers `train.jsonl`/`data.jsonl`/`dataset.jsonl` or suggests `.jsonl` files found, instead of an opaque "Is a directory" error
- **Tokenizer-not-found guidance**: Error now explains that GGUF models don't bundle tokenizers and suggests `pmetal download <model-id>`
- **Memory stats NaN**: `pmetal memory` guards against division by zero when `total_gb()` is 0
- **EOS token stripping**: `extract_final_response` now strips all known EOS tokens (was only `<|im_end|>` and `<|endoftext|>`)
- **Qwen3 LoRA gradient checkpointing warning**: Now emitted once per run instead of per-layer per-step (via `std::sync::Once`)
