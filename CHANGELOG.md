# Changelog

All notable changes to PMetal will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed

- **GPU occupancy waste in gradient scaling**: `scale_gradients` grid dispatch was 4x over-provisioned after float4/half4 vectorization — each thread processes 4 elements but the grid still dispatched one thread per element; corrected from `div_ceil(32)` to `div_ceil(128)`
- **Threadgroup memory overallocation in fused LoRA**: Static `threadgroup float[128 * 256]` arrays in `fused_lora_forward` and `fused_lora_backward_x` allocated 128KB each, exceeding Apple Silicon's 32KB threadgroup memory limit; switched to dynamic threadgroup memory via `setThreadgroupMemoryLength` with host-side size calculation based on actual tile and rank dimensions
- **Silent loss of final async checkpoint**: When `TrainingLoop` was dropped, the pending background checkpoint thread was silently detached — if the process exited before the thread finished, the final safetensors file could be truncated or corrupt; added `Drop` impl that joins the pending handle and logs errors
- **LoRA rank validation**: Raised rank limit from 64 to 256 to match `MAX_LORA_RANK` now that dynamic threadgroup memory removes the static allocation constraint

### Improved

- **Checkpoint I/O deduplication**: Extracted shared file write logic (`write_checkpoint_to_dir`) from `save_checkpoint`, `save_checkpoint_owned`, and `save_best_checkpoint` — eliminated ~100 lines of duplicated directory creation, safetensors serialization, and metadata JSON writes
- **Edge case test coverage**: Added tests for NEON fp16↔fp32 conversion (NaN, Inf, -Inf, -0.0, subnormals, exact 4-element alignment, 1M+ element arrays) and Accelerate vDSP wrappers (negative values, single-element arrays, 1M+ element arrays)

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-27

### Improved

- **Unified chat template detection**: New `detect_chat_template()` inspects `tokenizer_config.json` Jinja strings before falling back to model-name heuristics — training, inference, and distillation now detect templates consistently
- **Broader inference templates**: Added inference formatters for Llama-2, Gemma, Mistral, Phi-3, Phi-4, and GPT-OSS (previously only ChatML and Llama-3 were supported)
- **Template-aware stop tokens**: Inference now encodes the correct EOS token per template type (`<|eot_id|>` for Llama-3, `<end_of_turn>` for Gemma, etc.) instead of hardcoding `<|im_end|>`
- **Array chat_template support**: Handles HuggingFace models that store `chat_template` as an array of `{name, template}` objects (e.g., Command-R)
- **Distillation template detection**: Distillation now applies the student model's chat template during dataset formatting (was `None` before)
- **Distillation completion output**: Summary box with detected template and actionable next-steps command

### Fixed

- **Silent download failures**: Tokenizer and config file download errors now logged with `warn!`/`debug!` instead of silently swallowed with `let _ =`
- **Silent quantize fallback**: Invalid `--method` values now produce a clear error listing valid methods instead of silently falling back to Q4K
- **Dataset directory error**: Passing a directory to `--dataset` now auto-discovers `train.jsonl`/`data.jsonl`/`dataset.jsonl` or suggests `.jsonl` files found, instead of an opaque "Is a directory" error
- **Tokenizer-not-found guidance**: Error now explains that GGUF models don't bundle tokenizers and suggests `pmetal download <model-id>`
- **Memory stats NaN**: `pmetal memory` guards against division by zero when `total_gb()` is 0
- **EOS token stripping**: `extract_final_response` now strips all known EOS tokens (was only `<|im_end|>` and `<|endoftext|>`)
- **Qwen3 LoRA gradient checkpointing warning**: Now emitted once per run instead of per-layer per-step (via `std::sync::Once`)
