//! Shared SSE helpers for the OpenAI + Anthropic streaming endpoints.
//!
//! BPE tokenisers can split a multi-byte UTF-8 codepoint across two tokens
//! — emitting each `Tokenizer::decode(&[token])` independently would send
//! invalid `\xNN` byte sequences to the client, which most HTTP/SSE
//! consumers reject. [`IncrementalDecoder`] buffers the full token
//! sequence, decodes the growing buffer as a unit, and emits only the
//! confirmed text prefix that has already shown up in a complete decode.
//!
//! All three streaming handlers (`chat_sse_stream`, `completion_sse_stream`,
//! and Anthropic `messages` streaming) previously open-coded this pattern
//! with `token_buffer: Vec<u32>` + `emitted_text_len: usize`. Factoring it
//! here keeps the state machine in one place — the handlers only differ in
//! how they wrap the decoded text into their endpoint-specific event
//! frames.
