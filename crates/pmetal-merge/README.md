## Usage

### Linear Merge

```rust
use pmetal_merge::{MergeConfig, LinearMerge, run_merge};

let config = MergeConfig {
    method: MergeMethod::Linear,
    models: vec![
        ModelWeight { path: "model_a", weight: 0.7 },
        ModelWeight { path: "model_b", weight: 0.3 },
    ],
    output: "merged_model",
};

run_merge(&config)?;
```

### SLERP Merge

```rust
use pmetal_merge::{MergeConfig, MergeMethod};

let config = MergeConfig {
    method: MergeMethod::Slerp { t: 0.5 },
    models: vec![
        ModelWeight { path: "model_a", weight: 1.0 },
        ModelWeight { path: "model_b", weight: 1.0 },
    ],
    output: "merged_model",
};
```

### TIES Merge

```rust
use pmetal_merge::{MergeConfig, MergeMethod};

let config = MergeConfig {
    method: MergeMethod::Ties {
        density: 0.5,      // Keep top 50% of weights
        majority_sign: true,
    },
    models: vec![
        ModelWeight { path: "task_a", weight: 1.0 },
        ModelWeight { path: "task_b", weight: 1.0 },
        ModelWeight { path: "task_c", weight: 1.0 },
    ],
    base_model: Some("base_model"),
    output: "merged_model",
};
```

## Merge Methods Explained

### Linear
Simple weighted average: `merged = w1*m1 + w2*m2 + ...`

### SLERP
Spherical linear interpolation for smooth blending between two models. Parameter `t` controls interpolation (0.0 = model A, 1.0 = model B).

### TIES
Task Arithmetic with Interference Elimination:
1. Compute task vectors (fine-tuned - base)
2. Trim low-magnitude weights
3. Resolve sign conflicts by majority vote
4. Merge remaining weights

### DARE
Drop And REscale:
1. Randomly drop weights with probability p
2. Rescale remaining weights by 1/(1-p)
3. Reduces interference between models. Available in TIES and Linear variants.

### Task Arithmetic
Direct task vector addition: `merged = base + w1*(m1-base) + w2*(m2-base) + ...`

### DELLA
Adaptive magnitude-based pruning. Prunes weights based on their magnitude relative to the base model, preserving important changes.

### Model Stock
Geometric interpolation using task vector similarity. Computes merge weights based on geometric properties of the fine-tuning directions.

### Passthrough
Layer passthrough composition — select layers from different models to build a "Frankenstein" model.
