//! Command allocator pool for Metal 4 / MPP command buffers.
//!
//! On Metal 4, `MTL4CommandAllocator` owns the memory backing encoded GPU
//! commands.  The critical safety invariant is that an allocator MUST NOT be
//! reset until every command buffer that drew from it has completed on the GPU.
//! Violating this causes a SIGSEGV because the GPU may still be reading command
//! memory that has been returned to the heap.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The pool maintains a fixed-size array of [`AllocatorSlot`]s.  Each slot
//! transitions through the following states:
//!
//! ```text
//! Idle ──► InFlight { event, value } ──► Idle (after GPU signals event)
//! ```
//!
//! [`CommandAllocatorPool::acquire`] scans for an `Idle` slot.  If none is
//! available it polls all `InFlight` slots, resets any whose `MTLSharedEvent`
//! has been signalled by the GPU, then waits in a short spin-sleep loop until
//! one becomes free.
//!
//! [`CommandAllocatorPool::release`] marks a slot `InFlight` — the caller is
//! responsible for signalling the associated event from the GPU timeline (via
//! `MTL4CommandQueue::signalEvent:value:`).
//!
//! [`CommandAllocatorPool::with_allocator`] is the primary entry point: it
//! acquires an idle slot, calls a closure with a reference to the allocator,
//! then returns the slot index for the caller to release after committing.
