//! Complete training loop with DataLoader integration.
//!
//! This module provides a unified training loop that:
//! - Connects DataLoader → Model → Optimizer
//! - Supports gradient accumulation
//! - Uses mlx-rs autodiff for gradient computation
//! - Optionally uses Metal FlashAttention for efficient forward pass
//! - Provides progress tracking and callbacks
//!
//! # Optimized Training Path
//!
//! The training loop uses a fused `jit_training_step` function that combines
//! forward pass, backward pass, and optimizer update. MLX's lazy evaluation
//! automatically optimizes the computation graph.
//!
//! ## State Warmup Requirement
//!
//! Optimizers like AdamW lazily initialize their internal state (momentum, velocity
//! buffers) on the first `update()` call. We use a warmup step to ensure all
//! optimizer states are properly initialized before the main training loop.
//!
//! ## Note on JIT Compilation
//!
//! mlx-rs provides `compile_with_state` for JIT compilation, but it has known
//! limitations with complex models + optimizers:
//!
//! 1. **State tracking overhead**: `compile_with_state` expects the compiled function
//!    to return all mutable state as additional outputs. For LLMs with 10M+ parameters,
//!    this creates a mismatch between expected and actual output counts.
//!
//! 2. **State count stability**: Even after warmup, the `Updatable::updatable_states_len()`
//!    can return counts that don't match what the compiled graph actually produces.
//!
//! 3. **Architectural difference**: Python's `mx.compile(fn, inputs=state, outputs=state)`
//!    explicitly tracks state containers, while mlx-rs tries to infer state automatically.
//!
//! ## Performance Comparison (Qwen3-0.6B, batch=4, seq=512)
//!
//! | Approach | Throughput | Notes |
//! |----------|------------|-------|
//! | mlx-lm (JIT) | ~2200-2300 tok/s | Full graph fusion via `mx.compile` |
//! | pmetal (fused) | ~1700-1800 tok/s | Deferred eval + warmup |
//! | pmetal (basic) | ~500-600 tok/s | Per-step evaluation |
//!
//! The fused training path (`--fused` flag) uses deferred evaluation which achieves
//! approximately 75-80% of mlx-lm's JIT-compiled throughput. The gap is primarily due
//! to mlx-rs's `compile_with_state` limitations with complex models.
//!
//! ## Using the Optimized Training Path
//!
//! Enable fused training for best performance:
//! ```bash
//! pmetal train --model <model> --dataset <data> --fused --use-metal-flash-attention
//! ```
//!
//! Note: Fused training requires `gradient_accumulation_steps=1`.
//!
//! The `jit_compile` module provides experimental utilities for future JIT support
//! when mlx-rs improves its compile_with_state implementation.
