//! Canonical expert-ID ↔ rank mapping for expert-parallel and tensor-parallel.
//!
//! # The invariant
//!
//! A single rule decides which experts live on which rank. Every module that
//! cares about "who owns expert `e`" — routing, weight sharding, ZeRO
//! optimizer partitioning — must derive its answer from the same formula:
//!
//! 1. Each rank `r` owns `base = total_experts / world_size` experts.
//! 2. The first `remainder = total_experts % world_size` ranks each get
//!    one extra expert, so rank 0 owns `[0..base+1)`, rank 1 owns
//!    `[base+1..2*(base+1))`, …, rank `remainder` owns `[offset..offset+base)`, etc.
//! 3. The local expert index is simply `expert_id - start_for_rank(r)`.
//!
//! If any module computes this mapping differently, expert-parallel routing
//! will send tokens to ranks whose weight shards don't include the
//! addressed experts — producing silent wrong-answers or shape errors.
//!
//! # Why "remainder to the first ranks"?
//!
//! This matches DeepSpeed's `distribute_experts` behavior and mlx-lm's
//! `_shard_experts`. A naïve `rank * base` indexing ignores the remainder
//! and leaves the tail experts unowned, which is the bug this module
//! exists to prevent.

/// Returns `(start_expert_id, count)` for the given rank.
///
/// `start..start+count` is the half-open range of global expert IDs
/// that rank owns. This is the one definition; every call site that asks
/// "which experts does this rank own" must come through here.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// - `world_size == 0` — call sites should never ask for a zero-rank plan.
/// - `rank >= world_size` — programmer error.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Uniform split (divisible):
/// ```
/// # use pmetal_distributed::expert_shard::expert_range;
/// assert_eq!(expert_range(512, 0, 4), (0, 128));
/// assert_eq!(expert_range(512, 3, 4), (384, 128));
/// ```
///
/// Non-divisible — first ranks take the remainder:
/// ```
/// # use pmetal_distributed::expert_shard::expert_range;
/// // 10 experts across 3 ranks: 4, 3, 3.
/// assert_eq!(expert_range(10, 0, 3), (0, 4));
/// assert_eq!(expert_range(10, 1, 3), (4, 3));
/// assert_eq!(expert_range(10, 2, 3), (7, 3));
