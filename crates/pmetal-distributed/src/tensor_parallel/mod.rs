//! Tensor parallelism for distributed inference and training.
//!
//! Splits model weights across multiple ranks so each rank holds a shard
//! of every layer. Communication happens within each layer via `all_sum`
//! (for row-sharded outputs) or implicit gradient synchronization
//! (for column-sharded inputs).
//!
//! # Sharding Pattern
//!
//! Following the Megatron-LM convention used by MLX:
//!
//! - **AllToSharded** (column parallel): Weight `[output/N, input]`.
//!   Each rank computes a slice of the output. No communication needed
//!   in forward; `sum_gradients` barrier needed for backward.
//!
//! - **ShardedToAll** (row parallel): Weight `[output, input/N]`.
//!   Each rank computes a partial result. `all_sum` reduces partial
//!   results to produce the full output.
//!
//! # Architecture Support
//!
//! The [`plan`] module provides architecture-agnostic plan builders
//! that read `config.json` to produce sharding plans for:
//! - Standard transformer attention (Llama, Mistral, etc.)
//! - SwiGLU FFN blocks
//! - GDN (gated delta net) blocks (Qwen 3.5)
//! - MoE layers (shared + routed experts)
//!
//! # Reference
//!
//! Based on mlx-lm's distributed linear layers and the Qwen 3.5
//! `shard()` implementation.
