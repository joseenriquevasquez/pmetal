/// # Convention
///
/// MLX `nn.Linear` stores weights as `[out_features, in_features]`:
///
/// - **Column-shard** (`AllToSharded`) splits `out_features` (axis 0).
///   Each rank produces a slice of the output; no communication needed.
/// - **Row-shard** (`ShardedToAll`) splits `in_features` (axis 1).
///   Each rank produces a partial sum; an `all_sum` reduces to the
///   full output.
///
/// For attention:
/// - Q / K / V projections: column-sharded (axis 0) — each rank owns a
///   slice of the heads.
/// - O projection: row-sharded (axis 1) — each rank consumes its head
///   slice and contributes a partial hidden-dim output; allreduce sums.
/// - Biases on column-sharded layers: sharded (axis 0, matches weight).
/// - Bias on the row-sharded O projection: **Replicated** — it is added
///   after the allreduce, so every rank needs the full vector.
///
/// # GQA
///
/// When `n_kv_heads < n_heads`, the KV projections have
/// `out_features = n_kv_heads * head_dim`. As long as
/// `world_size <= n_kv_heads` the split stays aligned. When
/// `world_size > n_kv_heads` the caller must replicate KV heads before
/// sharding (MLX's standard GQA handling).
