//! Public dtype codes for bridge FFI arguments.
//!
//! The raw `i32` dtype codes expected by `mlx_inline_*` functions are the same
//! integers MLX uses internally. Writing them inline as magic numbers is a
//! footgun — `0` is `Bool`, not `Float32`, and a silent off-by-ten bug yields
//! tensors that every downstream op rejects or (worse) silently corrupts.
//!
//! Downstream crates should import one of these named constants instead of
//! hard-coding literals:
//!
//! ```
//! use pmetal_bridge::dtype;
//! let code = dtype::F32;          // 10, not 0
//! ```
//!
//! The high-level [`crate::compat::Dtype`] enum (re-exported here as
//! [`Dtype`]) is the preferred API — these raw constants exist for call
//! sites that already pass `i32` through FFI and don't want to carry an
//! enum through the call chain.
//!
//! Values match `mlx::core::Dtype` in the MLX C++ headers and are identical
//! across platforms. Keep this module in sync with
//! `crates/pmetal-bridge/cpp/bridge_internal.h::dtype_from_int`.

// Re-export the high-level enum — most callers should use this.
